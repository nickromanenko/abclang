Be Conversational: Use everyday language, making the chat feel like talking to a friend.
Be Proactive: Lead the conversation, often wrapping up with a question or next-step suggestion.

Get clarity: If the user only partially answers a question, or if the answer is unclear, keep asking to get clarity.

Refrain from saying, "You can send emails." Depending on the context, consider saying, "I will arrange for a project manager to contact you."
By the end of the conversation, if you do not have at least the Full Name, Phone Number, and Email Address, you should re-prompt the user for these details.
Do not say "I can't send email" - just ask the applicant/job seeker to email all necessary information.

If a user declines, you should acknowledge their decision and proceed with the conversation as best as possible without causing friction.

Why and When You Need Transcreation and International Copyrighting Services
Sometimes, the world has to hear your message. To make sure it has the impact you want, there will
be many situations when it is necessary to translate it, as well as many different ways to
communicate it to your global audience.
So what are your choices?
Standard technical translation can be applied to technical, factual, non-emotional documents.
These are often related to the engineering, financial, and medical fields, and might include machine
manuals, system descriptions and specifications, labelling of hazardous substances, safety
instructions, staff handbooks, annual reports, patient medical history, etc.
Certified translation will be often required for official purposes. This might relate to legal documents
and information such as birth, death and marriage certificates, legal contracts, academic transcripts,
etc.
Both standard and certified translation is usually a rigid, word-for-word, literal translation. Fine if
that’s what you’re looking for. But if you’re looking for translation that is a little more nuanced,
protecting the original meaning across languages and cultures, neither standard or certified
translation will do.
The fact is, when you need your marketing content to be used across a variety of regions and to
accurately reflect your marketing messages, you need transcreation or international copyrighting
services.

Transcreation – or international copywriting – is the best option when you need to adapt the
content to the local and cultural context. This might include advertisements and billboards – both
physical and digital – headlines and body copy, slogans and straplines. Indeed, any type of content
which you want to connect emotionally with your global audience.
During the process of transcreation, we move away from the source text to convey the essence of
the meaning in the target text. We consider the intent, context, style, tone, and emotion that will
need be adapted for local cultures to ensure your content retains the same impact and emotion as
the original.
Our team understands cultural reference and the value of maintaining consistency for your
communications and the brands you represent. Our creative linguists will use the right words and
the right tone to effectively communicate your content to your foreign audience. That is where we
go beyond translation to deliver exciting and relevant message that resonates with your
international audiences, compelling them to take actions you want them to take. Working with a
one-call solution, our international copyrighting agency reduces the time, cost, and effort of creating
quality content for multiple markets.
• A consistent tone of brand voice
Working with a dedicated team of professional bilingual copywriters helps protect the consistency of
communication for the brands you represent. As a result, you maintain the power of your marketing
messages, reinforce the brand platform, and build an authentic, long-lasting connection with
customers.
• Local culture and language
International copywriters interpret and transcreate your digital content in the localised mother
tongue, reflecting cultural trends and preferences. This ensures your branding and marketing
messages remain consistent across diverse countries, languages, and cultures.
